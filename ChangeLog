    * R/sme.R: sme.default and sme.list now store the normalizeTime argument in the sme object.
    getRoughnessMatrix() now properly takes into account scenarios where zeroIntercept and/or
    normalizeTime were used when fitting the model. plotSmeModel should now properly handle
    calculating drawing confidence bands when zeroIntercept was used when fitting the model

    * vignettes/Tutorial.Rnw: updated author's email address

2014-04-05  Maurice Berk <maurice@mauriceberk.com>

    * man/sme.Rd: added details concerning the specification of initial values for the smoothing
    parameter optimization

    * man/sme.data.frame.Rd: added details concerning the specification of initial values for the
    smoothing parameter optimization

    * man/sme.list.Rd: added details concerning the specification of initial values for the
    smoothing parameter optimization

    * R/sme.R: improved formatting. The call field of sme objects should now be more meaningful in
    cases where multiple fits were performed in one go. zeroIntercept is now properly implemented

    * src/SME.c: fixed a bug with the calculation of mu in MStep() where the penalty term was not
    correctly incorporating sigma^2. zeroIntercept is no longer used by the C code

    * src/SME.h: zeroIntercept is no longer used by the C code

2013-09-29  Maurice Berk <maurice@mauriceberk.com>

    * DESCRIPTION: Package version is now 0.9, Date is now 2013-09-29

    * R/sme.R: can now specify initial values for the smoothing parameters to be used in the NM
    optimization

    * src/SME.c: initial values for smoothing parameters in NM optimization are now taken as the
    lambdaMu and lambadV arguments to SMEOptimization(). Fixed a bug where abs() was used rather
    than fabs() causing all fractional smoothing parameters to be rounded

2013-07-20  Maurice Berk <maurice@mauriceberk.com>

    * DESCRIPTION: Date is now 2013-04-02, Version is now 0.5, author's email address updated

    * src/SME.c: OpenMP code is now properly guarded to ensure it's supported by the compiler

    * vignettes/Tutorial.Rnw: added a sentence explaining that OpenMP may not be supported depending
    on the platform

2012-09-18  Maurice Berk <maurice@mauriceberk.com>

    * DESCRIPTION: Date is now 2012-09-18

    * vignettes/Tutorial.Rnw: updated description of OpenMP functionality to reflect the default
    behaviour changing from using two threads to letting the OpenMP system automatically handle the
    number of threads. Fixed a broken reference to one of the plots

2012-09-04  Maurice Berk <maurice@mauriceberk.com>

    * DESCRIPTION: Date is now 2012-09-04

    * src/*.f: collated all individual LAPACK routines into a single file, LapackSubset.f

    * man/sme.list.Rd: updated documentation for sme.list to reflect the new default value for the
    parameter numberOfThreads

    * src/LinearAlgebra.c: changed to UNIX line endings

    * src/NelderMead.c: changed to UNIX line endings

    * src/NelderMead.h: changed to UNIX line endings

    * src/SME.h: changed to UNIX line endings

    * Makevars: replaced PKG_FFLAGS=-frecursive with the more appropriate
    PKG_FFLAGS=$(SHLIB_OPENMP_FFLAGS)

2012-08-10  Maurice Berk <maurice@mauriceberk.com>

    * src/LinearAlgebra.c: removed any references to the LAPACK routines provided by R

    * Makevars: removed $(LAPACK_LIBS) from PKG_LIBS, added PKG_FFLAGS=-frecusrive to ensure local
    arrays in the new Fortran code are thread-safe

    * src/*.f: added those LAPACK 3.4.1 routines which are called from LinearAlgebra.c directly to
    the package, as the ones built-in to R are not thread-safe

    * src/SME.c: changed calls to nmmin() to NelderMead(), removed all omp critical pragmas

    * src/NelderMead.c, src/NelderMead.h: adapted the built-in R NelderMead search function nmmin()
    to be thread-safe

    * src/SME.c: fixed a memory leak in calculateDegreesOfFreedom()

2012-07-31  Maurice Berk <maurice@mauriceberk.com>

    * R/sme.R: the default option for number of threads to use when carrying out multiple SME fits
    in parallel is now -1, which indicates OpenMP should manage the number of threads dynamically

    * src/SME.c: added the ability to let OpenMP manage the number of threads dynamically by
    passing a value of -1 for numberOfThreads to SMEOptimizationMultiple() and SMEMultiple()

2012-07-29  Maurice Berk <maurice@mauriceberk.com>

    sme.list to properly return model residuals

2012-07-20  Maurice Berk <maurice@mauriceberk.com>

    * src/SME.c: removed original implementation of degrees of freedom calculation which had been
    commented out but remained in the file for some reason
