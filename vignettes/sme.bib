  abstract = {A bias correction to the Akaike information criterion, AIC, is derived
	for regression and autoregressive time series models. The correction
	is of particular use when the sample size is small, or when the number
	of fitted parameters is a moderate to large fraction of the sample
	size. The corrected method, called AICC, is asymptotically efficient
	if the true model is infinite dimensional. Furthermore, when the
	true model is of finite dimension, AICC is found to provide better
	model order choices than any other asymptotically efficient method.
	Applications to nonstationary autoregressive and mixed autoregressive
	moving average time series models are also discussed.},

  journal = {Biostatistics},

  pages = {kxp022},
  abstract = {Time course gene microarray is an important tool to identify genes
	with differential expressions over time. Traditional analysis of
	variance (ANOVA) type of longitudinal investigation may not be applicable
	because of irregular time intervals and possible missingness due
	to contamination in microarray experiments. Functional principal
	components analysis is proposed to test hypotheses in the change
	of the mean curves. A permutation test under a mild assumption is
	used to make the method more robust. The proposed method outperforms
	the recently developed extraction of differential gene expression
	and a 2-way mixed effects ANOVA under reasonable gene expression
	models in simulation. Real data on transcriptional profiles of blood
	cells microarray from treated and untreated individuals were used
	to illustrate this method.},

  abstract = {Characterizing the genome-wide dynamic regulation of gene expression
	is important and will be of much interest in the future. However,
	there is currently no established method for identifying differentially
	expressed genes in a time course study. Here we propose a significance
	method for analyzing time course microarray studies that can be applied
	to the typical types of comparisons and sampling schemes. This method
	is applied to two studies on humans. In one study, genes are identified
	that show differential expression over time in response to in vivo
	endotoxin administration. By using our method, 7,409 genes are called
	significant at a 1\% false-discovery rate level, whereas several
	existing approaches fail to identify any genes. In another study,
	417 genes are identified at a 10\% false-discovery rate level that
	show expression changing with age in the kidney cortex. Here it is
	also shown that as many as 47\% of the genes change with age in a
	manner more complex than simple exponential growth or decay. The
	methodology proposed here has been implemented in the freely distributed
	and open-source edge software package.},
