\title{Extract the roughness matrix used in an SME model fit}
\description{Given an \code{sme} object, returns the roughness matrix which can be used to quickly
calculate the integrated squared second derivative of the mean and individual level curves}


\arguments{
  \item{object}{a fitted SME model object returned from the \code{sme} function}
}

\details{
The parameters of the SME model are estimated using maximum \emph{penalized} likelihood, where the
penalized likelihood is the standard likelihood with the addition of penalty terms corresponding to
the roughness of the mean and individual level curves. Typically the roughness of a curve is
quantified as its integrated squared second derivative. Green and Silverman (1994) show that, for a
natural cubic spline interpolating the vector of points $f$, there exists a \emph{roughness matrix}
$G$ such that the integrated squared second derivate is $f'Gf$ where $f'$ denotes $f$ transposed.
For details on constructing the matrix $G$, either refer to the original source of
Green and Silverman (1994) or it may prove easier to access Berk and Montana (2009) where they can
be found in the appendix.
